            <h2>Practice Git Project</h2>

            <p>To advance their git and version control skills, Jamie and Christina teamed up to contribute to the same git repository. They both work on separate elements of the project on their own git branches, commit and push their changes, run pull requests, and then merge their changes to the master branch.</p>

            <p>Since they both recognize the need for efficient, clean code, Jamie and Christina are also using this site as a place to get better at using Sass to write their CSS.</p>

            <p>Please bear with them as this project goes through various changes. They're also both searching for front end developer positions, so if you know someone who needs their skills, hit them up.</p>
